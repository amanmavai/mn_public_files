> ## DFS
DFS (Depth-First Search) in a graph is like exploring a network of connected points. Starting from one point, you keep moving to a connected point that you haven't visited yet, going deeper into the network. When you can't go any further, you backtrack to the last point where you had other options and explore a different path. You continue this process until you've checked out every point in the network.

> ## BFSIterative
Starting from the root, all the nodes at a particular level are visited first and then the nodes of the next level are traversed till all the nodes are visited.
Links: https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/algorithms/graphs/breadth-first-search/visualize/

BFS is a traversing algorithm where you should start traversing from a selected node (source or starting node) and traverse the graph **layerwise** thus exploring the neighbour nodes (nodes which are directly connected to source node). You must then move towards the next-level neighbour nodes.
```js
function BFSIterative(start, graph) {
  let result = []
  let visited = new Set([start]);
  let queue = [start]

  while (queue.length) {
    let v = queue.shift()

    neighbours.forEach((n) => {
      if (!visited.has(n)) {
        visited.add(n);

      }
    })
  }

> # Shortest Path Dijkstra Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is a way to find the shortest path from one point (or "vertex") to all other points in a network of points connected by lines (or "edges")

Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm finds a shortest path tree from a single source node, by building a set of nodes that have minimum distance from the source. **Single Source Shortest Path**.
Find shortest path from some starting vertex to all the other vertices.
Use minimum priority queue to select next minimum vertex
If we find the new minimum then perform relaxation procedure.

> # Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

A **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** is a concept from graph theory, which is used in the context of a connected, undirected graph. It refers to a subset of the edges of the graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles, and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

### Why is it a Tree?

1. **Connects All Vertices**: Like a tree in nature, which has branches extending out from a single trunk, a spanning tree in a graph connects all the vertices together. In a graph, vertices are like the nodes, and edges are like the branches.

2. **No Cycles**: A tree doesn't loop back on itself; it only branches out. Similarly, a spanning tree in a graph contains no cycles. This means you can't start at one vertex, travel along the edges of the tree, and return to the same vertex without retracing your steps.

3. **Minimum Number of Edges**: A tree has the fewest branches necessary to keep it connected. In a graph, a spanning tree has the fewest edges needed to connect all the vertices. For a graph with `V` vertices, any spanning tree will have exactly `V-1` edges.

### Why "Minimum" Spanning Tree?

- The "minimum" in Minimum Spanning Tree refers to the total weight of the edges in the tree being as small as possible. In a graph where edges have weights (or costs), the MST is the spanning tree with the lowest total cost.

### Applications of MST

The concept of a Minimum Spanning Tree has practical applications in various fields. Some examples include:

1. **Network Design**: Designing the least expensive network, like laying out electricity cables or water pipelines, where you want to connect a set of points (like cities or houses) with the least total distance (or cost).


### Algorithms for Finding MST

Several algorithms can be used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph, with Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms being the most famous. Both are efficient in different scenarios and are based on greedy strategies, where the algorithm makes the best choice (like picking the smallest edge) at each step.

In summary, a Minimum Spanning Tree is a subset of a graph that forms a tree connecting all vertices with the least total edge weight and no cycles. It is a fundamental concept with various practical applications in computer science and other fields.

> # Kruskal's Algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm is a popular and efficient method used in computer science to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) for a connected, undirected graph.
Links: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZlRH0eK-qQ

### How Kruskal's Algorithm Works:

1. **Sort Edges by Weight**:
   The algorithm starts by sorting all the edges of the graph in non-decreasing order based on their weight. This means the edges with the smallest weights are considered first.

2. **Initialize Forest**:
   Initially, each vertex of the graph is considered as a separate tree (or set) in a forest. In other words, each vertex is its own disjoint set.

3. **Select Edges**:
   The algorithm iterates through the sorted edges. For each edge, it checks if the vertices connected by the edge belong to different trees (disjoint sets). If they do, it means adding this edge won't create a cycle.

4. **Union of Sets**:
   If the edge connects two different trees, it's added to the MST, and the two disjoint sets (trees) are merged (union operation). This step is crucial for ensuring that we do not introduce cycles into the MST.

5. **Cycle Detection**:
   Kruskal's algorithm uses a disjoint-set data structure to keep track of which vertices are in which components or sets. This structure helps efficiently check whether adding an edge will create a cycle.

6. **Repeat Until One Tree**:
   This process is repeated until all vertices are contained in a single tree, which then represents the minimum spanning tree of the graph.


```js
function kruskal(graph) {
    if (graph.isDirected) {
        throw new Error("Kruskal's algorithms works only for undirected graphs");
    }

    const disjointSet = new DisjointSet();
    graph.getVertices().forEach(vertex=>disjointSet.makeSet(vertex));

    // will have minimum spanning tree of original graph.
    const mst = new Graph(graph.getVertices(),[],false);

    const sortedEdges = graph.getAllEdges().sort((e1, e2) => e1[2] - e2[2]);
    sortedEdges.forEach(([start, end, weight]) => {
        // check if edge forms a cycle. If it does then skip it.
        if (!disjointSet.inSameSet(start, end)) {
            disjointSet.union(start, end);
            mst.addEdge(start, end, weight);
        }
    });

    return mst;
}

let vertices = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i']
let edges = [
  ['a', 'b', 4],

> # Prim's Algorithm
### Differences from Dijkstra
Prim's: The priority queue in Prim's algorithm is used to select the next vertex to add to the MST based on the lowest edge weight connecting it to the MST.   

Primâ€™s algorithm emphasizes the weight of the individual edge being added to the MST. It doesn't accumulate weights along a path but rather looks at the immediate cost of connecting a new vertex to the existing MST   

Dijkstra's: In Dijkstra's algorithm, the priority queue serves to determine the next vertex to process based on the shortest cumulative distance from the source.

```js
function prims(graph, startVertex) {
  // the weight of the minimum edge connecting each vertex to the vertices already included in the MST.
  const minEdgeWeights = new Map();
  const predecessors = new Map();
  const result = new Set();
  const priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue();
  const vertices = [...graph.adjList.keys()];

  // Initialize minEdgeWeights and predecessors
  vertices.forEach((vertex) => {
    minEdgeWeights.set(vertex, Infinity);
